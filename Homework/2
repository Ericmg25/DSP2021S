•	I expected the problem to still divide by 2, but that was not the case and came up with an error
•	This version worked and divided the 1 by 2
•	I cannot get this to run because “int8” is not defined.
•	Same problem above. I found “int” in the examples, but int8 does not work
•	I expected this to not run as anything but instead got 7 as the numbers added
•	I expected this to be 25 because of the square but instead got -25
•	I xpected this one to be -3 but instead got -7
•	This changed to 25 instead of staying at -25
•	I expected this to go from left to right in operations and got 7
•	This also would go from left to right and got 30

value, variable, type, syntax error
This code results in a syntax error
Line 1, 2, and 3 give a, b, and c a value of 1, x, and true respectively
I am not sure what the command “who a b c” does
Line 5 looks to see if you’re a and c are the same.
Line 6 adds both
d and e are both lists and f is a nested list 
g combines the both and h is connected to I making a list.
Class(a) is an invalid syntax
2. part A
These id’s allow for each variable that is listed to have their unique id that is different from the rest.
