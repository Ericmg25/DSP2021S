5)Name an ancestor programming language of C.  
-Fortran

6)Name a programming language ancestor of C++.  
-C

7)Name a programming language ancestor of MATLAB and a programming language ancestor of Python.  
-Fortran

8)What are the three common types of errors in computer programs? Provide an example for each category.  
-Syntax; unknown language. Logic; misordered operation. Semantic; Problem with storing.  

9)Suppose you write a program that has memory leak. What type of programming error you dealing with?  
 -Semantic  

10)What is the biggest integer (in base 10) that you could store in an int32 type?  
 -2147483647

11)What is the difference between int16 and the int64 types?  
-The amount of integers they can store varies. int64 can store 48 more integers.

12)Write a single-line python script, 


13)What are some popular usages of the underscore symbol _ in Python? Name and explain at least three.  

14)Create a tuple variable with only one element valued 1.  

15)Make a string from the following list, with one one-line of Python code.  

16)Are tuple variables mutable objects? Can they be redefined?  
-Tuple variables cannot be redefined.    

17)How do you define an empty dictionary?    
-You can use {}  

18)When an integer overflow happens in Python, what is the expected behavior (what value would be assigned to the overflowed variable)? You may explain with an example.  

19)Suppose we have the following matrix. Write a dictionary representation of this matrix.
sparseMatrixList = [ [ 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 ]
                   , [ 2 , 0 , 0 , 0 ]
                   , [ 0 , 5 , 0 , 0 ]
                   , [ 0 , 0 , 0 , 3 ]
                   , [ 0 , 0 , 8 , 0 ]
                   ]
Extra credit: Suppose we have the following matrix. Write a sparse dictionary representation of this matrix (omitting zeros).
sparseMatrixList = [ [ 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 ]
                   , [ 2 , 0 , 0 , 0 ]
                   , [ 0 , 5 , 0 , 0 ]
                   , [ 0 , 0 , 0 , 3 ]
                   , [ 0 , 0 , 8 , 0 ]
                   ]
Extra credit: What are the three fundamental components of a Turing-complete language?

Extra credit: How would you distinguish exponential behavior vs. power-law behavior (function) in a 2-dimensional plot?
Hint: Recall our discussion of the ENAIC project and the relative frequency of keywords such as “computer” in our programming
